Summary
-------

* In 2016 identified opportunity in creating and hosting virtual reality content focused on sports. For example, imagine as a tennis fan being able to put on a headset and walk around a virtual replica of Wimbledon whilst watching Roger Federer highlights.  

* Created a basic web app prototype using Ruby-on-rails and javascript to support conversations with investors and studios.  

* Resulted in securing two new clients for the consulting service I ran at the time.
